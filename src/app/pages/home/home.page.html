<h1>Simplicity, Stillness, Grace</h1>
<h2>Slideshow</h2>
<p>
  May the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be acceptable in your presence, O LORD, my Rock and Redeemer. - Psalm 19:14
</p>
<p>
  The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul; He guideth me in straight paths for His name’s sake. - Psalm 23:1-3
</p>

<p>
  But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him. - Habakkuk 2:20
</p>
<p>
  ‘Be still, and know that I am God;
I will be exalted among the nations,
I will be exalted in the earth.’
- Psalm 46:10
</p>

  About The Way
</h2>
Not a religion... a RELATIONSHIP!
<p>
  The Way is for followers of Yeshua who seek a closer, more fulfilling relationship with HaShem, the One G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The meaning of the word "Christian" has been hijacked and turned into something our beloved Meshiach would never have approved of. Many reform groups have attempted to return to The Way that Yeshua originally preached, and their success has been equivalent to how dedicated they are staying true to the spirit of the scripture in their doctrines.</p>
<p>

Instead of a new doctrine, The Way is about finding out what He wants for each of us individually. Instead of grudging obedience to what other people tell us we are supposed to do, we ask the Father directly. And He Answers!

  Why G-d?

<!-- <p class="primary">
  Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. - Exodus 20:7
</p>
<p>
  Unless directly quoting scripture in a respectful way, many people choose not to utter or write the name of G-d. A common practice is to refer to Him as HaShem ("The Name" in Hebrew). This is not required, and is a personal preference chosen for many reasons. One of those reasons is that words like "G-d", "Christian", and even "Jesus" have been terribly abused and misused.
</p>

<p>
  Much of our modern biblical language comes from Rome or Greece, not the original Hebrew and Aramaic Yeshua himself spoke. To make matters worse Constantine's Roman form of Christianity has seemingly forever tarnished and manipulated our precious Saviour's name and message beyond recognition.

  People tolerate it today in subtle forms: the names of days of the week, months of the year, and even resting on SUNdays (the day to remember the sun-god Apollo as decreed by Constantine!). It is tolerated because people got used to it, and change is not easy. For some, this is not a good enough reason to continue with these traditions that clearly are not biblical. For those who do not feel this way, that is between you and HaShem. We are not here to judge, but to help you find your way to Him.
